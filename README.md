This is an AI developed TikTacToe game. The algorithm used in this project is a minimax algorithm, a recursive decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player games. 
In this case, it's applied to the Tic Tac Toe game to determine the optimal moves for the AI player ('O') against the human player ('X'). 
The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and assigns scores based on the outcomes, enabling the AI to make strategic decisions and play competitively.
